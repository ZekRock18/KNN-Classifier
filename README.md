# 🤖 KNN Classifier for Classified Data Analysis 📊

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to analyze and predict classes in a classified dataset. The model includes feature scaling, cross-validation, and error rate analysis to determine the optimal number of neighbors (K).

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- KNN classification with customizable K value
- Performance metrics visualization
- Cross-validation implementation
- Error rate analysis

## 📋 Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required:
```python
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.3
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
scikit-learn==1.2.2
```

## 📊 Data Processing Steps
1. Load the classified data from CSV
2. Scale features using StandardScaler
3. Split data into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets
4. Train KNN model with initial K=33
5. Generate predictions and performance metrics
6. Analyze error rates for K values from 1 to 40

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The script provides:
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
- Error rate visualization for different K values

## 📉 Visualization
The project includes a plot showing:
- Error rates vs K values
- Clear markers for each data point
- Dashed line for trend visualization

## 🔍 Results Interpretation
- The confusion matrix shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
- The classification report provides detailed metrics for model performance
- The error rate plot helps in identifying the optimal K value
